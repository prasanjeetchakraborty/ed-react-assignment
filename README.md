# React Assignment - Effective Digital 
## Presented by Prasanjeet Chakraborty

### Task: Web API Application (React)

The importance of AJAX and JSON is growing exponentially on the web. This exercise is aimed at
testing your knowledge of React, JavaScript, CSS, UI design, and your creativity.
For this example we will be using a simple image API.

### For this exercise:

1) Make an AJAX GET request to http://styleguide.effectivedigital.com/interview/api/animals
(you may use a library to do this if you wish).
2) Format the results into a list. Each item must include a title, description, and a small thumbnail
version of the image. The list can be displayed vertically, horizontally, in a grid, however you wish.
3) Create a modal dialog that displays the full sized version of an image and any additional details
provided in the JSON (e.g. Family, Genus, Collective Noun). The modal should appear after clicking
on a thumbnail.
4) Create two navigation items (or buttons) at the top of page - “Animals” and “Fruit & Veg”.
5) Repeat steps 1-3 for the following URL:
http://styleguide.effectivedigital.com/interview/api/fruitveg
6) Make the two navigation items in the top bar load the appropriate lists.
7) Create a good looking user interface using CSS.
8) Optimize your code as much as possible for performance and readability, adding comments where
necessary.
9) Structure and set up your working directory in a manageable fashion, organize your folder hierarchy.


### Notes:

1) Since this task will be built with React, we strongly recommend using create-react-app to set up
your project. This sets up the barebones for a react project, including development and
production build scripts, making it simple for you to work on locally, then host on GitHub or
send to us. Visit https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/ for more details.
2) If you don’t want to use this, the next best option will be to include the React/ReactDOM
libraries from https://unpkg.com/#/ in your index.html file.
Bonus points (optional)
1) Make use of the newer language features of JavaScript (ES6/ES7) in your code.
2) Use a CSS preprocessor(Sass/Less) or CSS-in-JS library to write your styles.
3) Anything else you think will wow us go for it! (e.g. Include your own build step with Webpack,
show off some subtle UI animations)

Note: If you experience CORS errors while using Google Chrome, we recommend testing your
application with Firefox or a recent version of Internet Explorer.
